## 2. Key Design Decisions

### 2.1 Microservices Architecture

We've adopted a microservices approach to achieve the following benefits:

- **Independent scaling**: Each service can scale based on its specific load patterns
- **Technology flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate language/framework
- **Team autonomy**: Different teams can work on different services
- **Fault isolation**: Failures in one service don't cascade to other services
- **Easier maintenance**: Smaller codebases are easier to understand and maintain

### 2.2 Service Decomposition

Services are decomposed by business domain:

- **Patient Service**: Handles patient registration, authentication, and profile management
- **Appointment Service**: Manages appointment scheduling, cancellation, and rescheduling
- **Doctor Service**: Maintains doctor profiles and availability information
- **Medical Records Service**: Stores and retrieves patient medical history
- **Notification Service**: Sends email and SMS notifications for appointments

### 2.3 Data Storage Strategy

#### Data Ownership

Each microservice owns its data exclusively and is the only service that can modify it directly. Other services must use the service's API to interact with its data.

#### Database Per Service

We've implemented a database-per-service pattern with the following characteristics:

- Each service has its own dedicated Cloud SQL database
- Databases are isolated for security and performance
- Service-specific database users with appropriate permissions

#### Data Consistency

Since we're using a distributed data architecture, we've implemented:

- **Event-driven architecture** using Pub/Sub for asynchronous communication
- **Eventual consistency** for cross-service data updates
- **Compensation transactions** for handling failures in distributed operations

### 2.4 Communication Patterns

#### Synchronous Communication

- REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication and client-to-service communication
- gRPC for high-performance internal service communication

#### Asynchronous Communication

- Pub/Sub for event-driven communication
- Event topics for major business events (appointment created, updated, cancelled)
- Subscribers for services that need to react to events

### 2.5 API Gateway

We use Cloud Run as an API Gateway to provide:

- Single entry point for all client applications
- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- Monitoring and logging

### 2.6 Security Architecture

#### Authentication and Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Integration with Google Identity Platform for user management

#### Data Protection

- Encryption in transit using TLS
- Encryption at rest using Google KMS
- Private network configuration with VPC
- Database encryption with customer-managed encryption keys

#### Compliance

- HIPAA-compliant infrastructure
- Audit logging for all sensitive operations
- Data residency controls

## 3. Scalability and Performance

### 3.1 Horizontal Scaling

All components are designed to scale horizontally:

- GKE auto-scaling for compute resources
- Cloud SQL high availability and read replicas
- Redis cache for frequently accessed data
- CDN for static content delivery

### 3.2 Performance Optimizations

- Connection pooling for database connections
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data and session state
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Content compression and delivery optimization

## 4. Resilience and Reliability

### 4.1 High Availability

- Multi-zone deployment for GKE clusters
- Regional Cloud SQL instances with automatic failover
- Load balancing across service instances
- Health checks and automatic instance replacement

### 4.2 Fault Tolerance

- Circuit breaker pattern for service-to-service communication
- Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Fallback mechanisms for degraded functionality
- Graceful degradation strategies

### 4.3 Disaster Recovery

- Regular database backups
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Multi-region backup storage
- Documented recovery procedures and regular testing

## 5. Observability

### 5.1 Monitoring

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization and dashboards
- Custom business metrics for appointment success rates, etc.
- Alerting based on SLIs/SLOs

### 5.2 Logging

- Structured logging across all services
- Centralized log aggregation with Cloud Logging
- Log-based metrics for business insights
- Correlation IDs for request tracing

### 5.3 Tracing

- Distributed tracing with Cloud Trace
- End-to-end request visibility
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Integration with OpenTelemetry

## 6. Development, Deployment, and Operations

### 6.1 CI/CD Pipeline

- Source control with GitHub
- Automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Container image building and security scanning
- Automated deployment to staging and production
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

### 6.2 Environment Strategy

- Development, staging, and production environments
- Environment parity for reliable testing
- Feature flags for controlled rollouts
- Blue/green deployment strategy

### 6.3 Operational Procedures

- Runbooks for common operational tasks
- Incident response procedure
- On-call rotation
- Post-incident reviews and continuous improvement

## 7. Cost Optimization

### 7.1 Resource Efficiency

- Auto-scaling to match demand
- Preemptible VMs for non-critical workloads
- Resource quotas and budget alerts
- Regular cost reviews and optimization

### 7.2 Storage Tiering

- Lifecycle policies for Cloud Storage (medical records)
- Cold storage for archived data
- Cost-efficient backup strategies

## 8. Future Evolution

### 8.1 Planned Enhancements

- AI-powered appointment scheduling suggestions
- Real-time chat integration for doctor-patient communication
- Telehealth video consultation integration
- Health wearables data integration

### 8.2 Technical Debt Management

- Scheduled refactoring sprints
- Code quality metrics and goals
- Architectural decision records
- Technical retrospectives
