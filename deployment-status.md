## Kubernetes Deployment
The Kubernetes deployments could not be completed due to the following issue:

- Missing `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` for kubectl authentication
- This plugin requires administrator privileges to install

## Next Steps

1. **Install GKE Auth Plugin**:
   ```
   gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
   ```
   (Requires administrator privileges)

2. **Complete Docker Image Builds**:
   - Fix npm dependency issues in frontend
   - Retry pushing appointment-service and doctor-service images

3. **Deploy Database Resources**:
   - Create Cloud SQL instances
   - Create Redis instances

4. **Deploy Kubernetes Resources**:
   - Create namespace
   - Create secrets
   - Deploy services
   - Configure ingress

5. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check pod status
   - Test service endpoints
   - Configure monitoring

## Commands to Check Deployment Status

```powershell
# Check GKE cluster status
gcloud container clusters list

# Check container images
gcloud container images list

# Check deployed secrets
gcloud secrets list

# Check Kubernetes deployments (after installing gke-gcloud-auth-plugin)
kubectl get deployments -n healthcare-system
```
